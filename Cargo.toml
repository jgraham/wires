# As a temporary workaround we pin certain dependencies exactly so that
# cargo will not complain about missing vendored crate versions when we
# build geckodriver from mozilla-central.
#
# We do not quite know yet why `./mach vendor rust` does not transitively
# vendor dependencies' dependencies, but the following list is the
# current available crate versions under third_party/rust that we can use.
